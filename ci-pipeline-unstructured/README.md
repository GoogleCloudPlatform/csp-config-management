# CI Pipeline - Unstructured

This is an example for how to create a CloudBuild CI pipeline on an unstructured directory, so called because the config-root of this directory does not follow the ACM repo structure.
We will change the ConfigMap to adhere to the OPA Gatekeeper constraint.

See [our documentation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/validating-configs) for how to set up this example.
